\usage{
make_templateGrid(
  filename = NULL,
  datatype = "FLT8S",
  template = NULL,
  interleave = "BSQ",
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{character string path to desired output file.}

\item{template}{A filepath or a gridded data object to be used as a 
template to define the output file's resolution and positioning.}

\item{interleave}{character string for band interleaving. Currently only 'BSQ' supported.}

\item{overwrite}{logical. Should the output file be overwritten if it already exists?
Default is \code{False}.}

\item{dataType}{character string of \code{raster} data types. Default is \code{FLT8S}}
}
\description{
Write data to binary files and structure as native \code{raster} files.
}
\details{
These functions provide a lightweight interface to binary writing demonstrated
in the \code{\link[spatial.tools]{}} package. The advantage of using binary files is 
the opportunity to using memory mapping (\code{mmap}) to support parallel writing.
