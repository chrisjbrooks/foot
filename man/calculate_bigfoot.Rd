\title{calculate_bigfoot: Gridded feature statistics for large sets of
  building footprint polygons}
\usage{
calculate_bigfoot(
  X,
  metrics = "all",
  focalRadius = 0,
  template = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE,
  nCores = parallel::detectCores() - 1,
  tileSize = c(1000, 1000),
  overlap = 0,
  outputPath = NULL,
  outputTag = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)

\method{calculate_bigfoot}{sf}(
  X,
  metrics = "all",
  template = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE,
  tileSize = c(1000, 1000),
  overlap = 0,
  outputPath = NULL,
  outputTag = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{object with building footprint polygons. This argument can take
multiple spatial types, including \code{sf} and \code{sp}, or a filepath
string to a file, or a list where each member provides a spatial object or
a filepath string.}

\item{metrics}{character vector. Names of footprint statistics in the form of
"fs_area_mean", etc. Other options include \code{ALL} or \code{NODIST} to
calculate all available metrics and all except nearest neighbour distances,
respectively.}

\item{template}{(optional). When creating a gridded output, a supplied
\code{stars} or \code{raster} dataset to align the data.}

\item{parallel}{logical. Should a parallel backend be used to process the
tiles.}

\item{nCores}{number of CPU cores to use if \code{parallel} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{tileSize}{number of pixels per side of a tile. Can be a vector of
length 2 (rows, column pixels). Ignored if n provided. Default is 1000.}

\item{overlap}{number of pixels of overlap between internal tiles}

\item{outputPath}{(optional). When creating a gridded output, a path for the
location of the output.}

\item{outputTag}{(optional). A character string that will be added tagged to
the beginning of the output gridded files.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Should progress messages be printed. Default
\code{False}.}

TBD.
